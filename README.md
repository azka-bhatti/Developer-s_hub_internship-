# Week 3: Understanding Unsupervised Learning

## 1. Clustering
Clustering is a technique used to group similar data points together without predefined labels.

## 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system, preserving maximum variance.

## 3. K-Means Clustering
K-Means is a widely used clustering algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance.

# Mini Project: Mall Customer Dataset Analysis

## 1. Problem Statement
Understanding customer segmentation to optimize business strategies.

## 2. Data Understanding
- Dataset: Mall Customer dataset
- Features: Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score
- Goal: Extract insights and categorize customers based on their spending habits.

## 3. Model Building
Applied both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques:
- **Supervised Learning**: Classification models to predict customer categories
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering methods like K-Means and PCA for segmentation

## 4. Evaluation
- Examined cluster quality using silhouette scores and visualization
- Assessed supervised models through accuracy and confusion matrices
