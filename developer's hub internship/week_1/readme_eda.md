# WEEK 01 THEORY (SHORT NOTES)

## 1. What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a technique that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being directly programmed. It uses certain libraries to train the model. Instead of following fixed instructions, ML models recognize patterns in data and use them to make predictions or decisions for the future.

## 2. Types of Machine Learning:
- **Supervised Learning** – The model is trained on labeled data (where labels of features are given), helping it make accurate predictions.  
  - Types:  
    1. Regression  
    2. Classification  
  - **Example:** Spam detection in emails.

- **Unsupervised Learning** – The model learns from unlabeled data and finds hidden patterns. It uses clusters of unrecognized data to train the model. It has a technique called clustering that makes small or large clusters based on patterns.  
  - **Example:** Customer segmentation in marketing.

- **Reinforcement Learning** – The model learns through feedback (trial and error) by receiving rewards or penalties.  
  - **Example:** AI playing video games and improving its strategy.

## 3. Difference Between AI, ML, and Deep Learning:
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** – The broad field of making machines simulate human intelligence, including reasoning, problem-solving, and learning.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** – A subset of AI that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data and improve without explicit programming.
- **Deep Learning** – A specialized branch of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to process complex data, such as recognizing faces in photos, translating languages, or detecting objects in an image.
